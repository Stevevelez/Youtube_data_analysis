<h1> Youtube project </h1>

XYZ company aimed to promote a song on YouTube. To achieve this, they obtained a YouTube database with the most-listened-to artists and tracks in recent times and asked me to answer three questions:

<br> * Number of characters used in the most-listened-to tracks.
<br> * Number of words in the track.
<br> * Best words to use.
<br>
<br> The Jupyter notebook inside this repository demonstrates the step-by-step process and the answers obtained.
